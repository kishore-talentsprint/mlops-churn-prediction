ml-ops-churn-prediction

for finding predictions: 
    navigate to src in terminal and use python3 run_model.py 

precautions: 
    make sure that the churn model is present on /models and load_model file has proper path. 
    the model takes 8 attributes as input, so run_model.py should take 8 inputs in encoded form. 

Note: 
    for every execution, there is git push, so commit before pushing
